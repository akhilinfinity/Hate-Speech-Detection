Hate Speech Detection

The Hate Speech Detection Project is an NLP-based application that classifies online text into hate speech, offensive language, or neutral. With the rapid growth of social media, this project provides a machine learning solution to identify harmful content and promote safe online communication.

🚀 Features

Preprocessing of text (cleaning, tokenization, lemmatization).

Feature extraction using Bag of Words, TF-IDF, or Word Embeddings.

Classification using Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, Random Forests, LSTMs, or Transformers.

Evaluation with accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix.

📂 Dataset

Public datasets such as Hate Speech and Offensive Language Dataset
 can be used.

Each text sample is labeled as hate speech, offensive, or neutral.

🛠️ Installation & Usage
